					<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>
					<p>EarlyOakland.com is a tool that allows parents to find free or low cost services for their children in Oakland. </p>

					<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
					<p>With the tools on the left column, you can find locations providing early care and education services. You can also search around an address or intersection.</p>
					<p>On the right side the service locations are plotted on a map of Oakland. Each point is clickable and will show you details about the services available and any restrictions for income eligibility.</p>

					<div class='clear'></div>
					<h2 id="who-is-it-for">Who is it for?</h2>

					</ul>

					<h2 id="why-did-you-make-it">Why did you make it?</h2>

					<p>The Oakland Education Cabinet, and its three chairs (Oakland Unified School District Superintendent Dr. Gary Yee, Mayor Jean Quan, and Mills College Dean of Education, Dr. Kathy Schultz) are pleased to share the following interactive map of locations for state and federally funded early care and education programs. The programs provide part day and full day early education and are free or low cost for qualifying families. The Cabinet encourages everyone in Oakland to share the map with parents and others who are raising children in our city. We know that the first five years of a childs life is a very important time for learning, and pre-school has been proven to assist children prepare for success in school and life.</p>

					<h2 id="i-need-more-info">This is great, but I need more info!</h2>
